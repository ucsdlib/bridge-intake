# This file is a template, and might need editing before it works on your project.
# Build JAVA applications using Apache Maven (http://maven.apache.org)

# This template will build and test your projects as well as create the documentation.
# 
# * Caches downloaded dependencies and plugins between invocation.
# * Does only verify merge requests but deploy built artifacts of the
#   master branch.
# * Shows how to use multiple jobs in test stage for verifying functionality
#   with multiple JDKs.
# * Uses site:stage to collect the documentation for multi-module projects.
# * Publishes the documentation for `master` branch.
